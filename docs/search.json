This 0.42 percentage point increase is statistically significant (t = 3.10, p = 0.002).\nThe linear regression confirms this: the coefficient on treatment is 0.0042, meaning being in the treatment group raises the probability of donating by 0.42 percentage points. These results closely match Table 2A Panel A of Karlan and List (2007), which reports 0.018 for control and 0.022 for treatment.\nThis suggests that even a simple message about matched donations can meaningfully increase the likelihood of giving. It highlights how small psychological cues can motivate pro-social behavior like charitable contributions.\n\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n                          Probit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

The probit coefficient on treatment is 0.0868 (p = 0.002), which is statistically significant.\nTo match Table 3 column 1 in Karlan and List (2007), we compute the marginal effect at the mean, which is approximately 0.0042 with a standard error of 0.001. This matches the reported value of 0.004 (0.001), confirming the validity of our replication.\nThis suggests that being assigned to the treatment group increased the probability of donating by approximately 0.42 percentage points.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\nt-stat\np-value\n\n\n\n\n0\n2:1 vs 1:1\n0.965\n0.3345\n\n\n1\n3:1 vs 1:1\n1.015\n0.3101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept      0.0207      0.001     14.912      0.000       0.018       0.023\nratio2         0.0019      0.002      0.958      0.338      -0.002       0.006\nratio3         0.0020      0.002      1.008      0.313      -0.002       0.006\n==============================================================================\n\n\nThe results show that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1 does not lead to a statistically significant increase in the probability of donating. Both t-tests and OLS regression confirm this: the coefficients are small (less than 0.2 percentage points), and the p-values are above 0.3, well beyond common significance thresholds.\nThis aligns with the authors’ conclusion that “larger match ratios do not have additional impact.” It suggests that what motivates behavior is the presence of a matching donation offer, not the magnitude of the match itself.\n\n\n\n3:1 vs 2:1 (via model) diff = 0.00010\n\n\nTo assess whether larger match ratios increase the likelihood of giving, we compute the response rate differences directly from the data and from the regression coefficients.\nThe donation rate for 1:1 is X%, for 2:1 is Y%, and for 3:1 is Z%. The differences between 2:1 and 1:1, and between 3:1 and 2:1, are both very small (less than 0.2 percentage points) and statistically insignificant.\nThis holds true whether we compute them from raw means or from the fitted coefficients in the OLS model. These findings confirm that higher match ratios do not produce significantly greater effects than lower ones.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n\n\nUnconditional Amount t-test: t = 1.918, p = 0.0551\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept      0.8133      0.067     12.063      0.000       0.681       0.945\ntreatment      0.1536      0.083      1.861      0.063      -0.008       0.315\n==============================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept     45.5403      2.423     18.792      0.000      40.785      50.296\ntreatment     -1.6684      2.872     -0.581      0.561      -7.305       3.968\n==============================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first examine donation amounts across treatment and control groups, regardless of whether someone donated. The t-test and regression indicate a slightly higher mean donation amount in the treatment group, though the difference is not statistically significant.\nNext, we restrict to only those who made a donation. The average conditional donation amount remains similar between treatment and control groups, and the regression confirms no significant difference. This suggests that while the match offer may increase whether people give, it does not significantly affect how much they give once they do.\nHistograms of the donation amounts show very similar distributions across both groups. A vertical line indicating the group mean helps visualize the small difference."

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers using the treatment and control donation amount distributions. We repeatedly drew 10,000 samples from each group (with replacement), subtracted the control amount from the treatment amount, and tracked the cumulative average of these differences.\nThe result is a curve that begins with substantial fluctuation and noise due to small sample size, but quickly stabilizes as more samples accumulate. Around 3,000–4,000 simulations, the estimate becomes relatively stable and converges to the true difference in means (shown by the red dashed line).\nThis visually confirms the Law of Large Numbers: as sample size increases, the sample average approaches the population average.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simulation illustrates the Central Limit Theorem by repeatedly sampling from the treatment and control groups at increasing sample sizes: 50, 200, 500, and 1000.\nFor each sample size, we took 1,000 independent draws from each group, computed the difference in their means, and plotted the histogram of those differences.\nWe observe the following:\n\nAt small sample sizes (n=50), the distribution of average differences is wide and irregular, with noticeable skewness and occasional outliers. The red vertical line (at zero) is often not near the center.\nAs the sample size increases, the distribution becomes narrower and more symmetric, forming a shape increasingly similar to a normal (bell curve) distribution.\nAt n=2000, the distribution is tightly concentrated around the true mean difference. The red line sits close to the center of the distribution, as predicted by the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nThis simulation provides strong visual evidence that as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original data’s shape. It also shows that with larger samples, our estimates become more stable and accurate."
